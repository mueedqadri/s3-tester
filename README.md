S3Uploader
==========

S3Uploader is a Java class that allows you to upload a file to an Amazon S3 bucket.

Usage
-----

1.  Create a new instance of the S3Uploader class, passing in the required parameters:

    -   `bucketName` - The name of the S3 bucket to upload the file to.
    -   `folderName` - The name of the folder within the bucket to upload the file to.
    -   `fileNameInS3` - The name of the file to be saved in S3.
    -   `fileNameInLocalPC` - The name of the file to be uploaded from your local computer.
2.  Call the `start()` method of the S3Uploader instance.




```
S3Uploader uploader = new S3Uploader("my-bucket", "my-folder", "file.txt", "path/to/local/file.txt");
uploader.start();
```
The `start()` method will attempt to upload the file to the specified S3 bucket. If the bucket does not exist, it will be created.

Dependencies
------------

S3Uploader uses the AWS SDK for Java to interact with Amazon S3. Make sure to include the SDK in your project's dependencies.
